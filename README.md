# Production Machine Learning - Clustering Case
I try to make an example of production machine learning with clustering case.

The documentation of the process :
* [Building Clustering Model](Building Clustering Model.ipynb)
* [Predicting the Cluster](Predicting the Cluster.ipynb)

You can run the **[predict_cluster.py](predict_cluster.py)** file on the command line to simulating the transformation process.
